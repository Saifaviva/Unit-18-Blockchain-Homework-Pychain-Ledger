Background:

This assignment aims to create a blockchain-based ledger system with a user-friendly online interface. This ledger enables partner banks or institutions to undertake financial transactions (e.g. money transfers between senders and receivers) and validate the ledger's data integrity and security.

Steps completed:

Create a new data class named Record. This class will serve as the blueprint for the financial transaction records that the blocks of the ledger will store.

Modify the existing Block data class to store Record data.

Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit interface.

Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records.

Streamlit Application
Streamlit is a tool for quickly creating and sharing data apps. In minutes, Streamlit transforms data scripts into shareable web apps.
